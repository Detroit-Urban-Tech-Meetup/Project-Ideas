# Project-Ideas

This is a place to store project ideas for the Detroit Urban Tech Meetup. 

If you have an idea for a project you'd like to see pursued by a group of data scientists, urban planners, map enthusiasts, or people who just plain care about Detroit, create an Issue and it'll be on the list for the next project night.
